# SIDM
Repository for the paper Effective Reinforcement Learning Based on Structural Information Principles.

a novel and general Structural Information principles-based framework for effective Decision-Making, namely SIDM, approached from an information-theoretic perspective.

a general framework and can be flexibly integrated with various RL algorithms, including Deep RL (DRL), Hierarchical RL (HRL), and Multi-Agent RL (MARL).
Extensive and empirical experiments are conducted on a visual gridworld, nine continuous control tasks, six bipedal robot tasks, and a StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark.<br>
