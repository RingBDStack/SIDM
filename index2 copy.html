    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This paper presents SIDM, a novel framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is a type of machine learning that acquires knowledge by interacting with its environment to achieve certain goals. However, RL algorithms often need fine-tuning of hyperparameters for optimal performance, especially in complex environments. SIDM overcomes these challenges by implementing a novel information-theoretic approach, improving sample efficiency, policy effectiveness, and does not require manual hyperparameter tuning.</p>

    <!-- Approach -->
    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>The SIDM framework includes modules for structuralization, sparsification, optimization, and abstraction. It constructs graphs using action-observation histories, then minimizes entropy in these graphs to create an optimal encoding tree. This tree enables hierarchical state or action abstraction, facilitating more efficient decision-making. SIDM is applicable to a variety of tasks, and in tasks with continuous spaces, it operates by discretizing and sampling.</p>
